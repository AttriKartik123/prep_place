Q. React Learning Process :
   1. go in-depth -> Babel , Fibre , Virtual DOM , DIff Algos , Hydration
   2. By Making Projects -> Todo , calculator ,  GitHub API (WE ARE TAKING THIS ROUTE TO CONQUER)

# React is a library :
-> Framework(Eg: Military) Vs Library(Cool Dude -> Freedom jyada hai)

# Topics to learn :
-> Core of react (state or UI Manipulation , JSX(Js ke andar html is called JSX))
-> Component reuability
-> Reusing the component (Props(Properties(Eg: {Key : "value}) is called properties))
-> How to propagate change (hooks)
-> SPA(Single page application)

# Aditional Addon to React :
-> Router (React don't have Router) 
-> State Management (React dont have state management)

Next-Day:

#react        : simply a library
#react-DOM    : related with websites
#react-native : related with apps

# npm create vite@latest 01_basic - "TO creae react project"
(It will create a react project named -01basic and it has various files including package.json public src etc)

# Use npm run ____ (to start anything )
Vite is a product of VERCEL.


"export default App :  export krda file nu App.jsx cho as a acompnenet to be

"HOOKS USED TO UPDATE DATA ON UI in react"

ALL ABOUT "Create root" - Creates its own Virtual DOM
JS apna ek virtaul tree bnata hai track krne k liye  


########## REACT FIBRE##############
react fibre is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algo . It is he culm of over two years of reaserach byu the raeact team .

the goal of the react fibre is to increase the sustainability for areas like animation , layout , gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering : The ability to spilt rendering into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames .

Other key features include the abiility to puase  , abort and reuse worjk as new update in : the ability to assign priority to differnet types of updates , and new concurrent primitives.

"""jabb page load ho rha hai and abhi usme javascript nhi aai(render) toh isse HYDRATION kehte hain"""
